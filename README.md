📊 Task-02 — Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains Task-02 of my Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.
The objective of this task is to perform comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of my choice. Through this task, I examined relationships between variables, identified trends, and derived meaningful insights from the data.

🔍 Task Overview

The primary aim of this task is to understand how to prepare raw data for analysis and how to explore a dataset using both visual and statistical techniques.

✔ Key Objectives

Load and inspect the dataset

Clean the data (handle missing values, duplicates, incorrect data types, etc.)

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualize relationships and patterns

Interpret insights from the dataset

📁 Sample Dataset

You may use any dataset of your choice.
A sample dataset provided by Prodigy InfoTech is available here:

🧹 Step 1 — Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process included the following steps:

Examining the dataset’s shape and structure

Handling missing values (using dropna, fillna, etc.)

Removing duplicate records

Converting data types (e.g., string → numeric)

Treating outliers (if necessary)

Renaming inconsistent column headers

Effective data cleaning ensures accuracy, consistency, and reliability for further analysis.

📊 Step 2 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to explore:

The content and characteristics of the dataset

The behavior of individual variables

Existing patterns or hidden trends

Relationships between multiple features

✔ Types of Analysis Performed

Univariate Analysis:

Analysis of a single variable

Visuals: Histograms, bar charts, count plots

Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis:

Relationship between two or more variables

Visuals: Scatter plots, heatmaps, correlation matrices

✔ Visualizations Used

Bar Charts

Histograms

Box Plots

Scatter Plots

Heatmaps

Pie Charts (optional)

📈 Example Insights
(These are sample insights; actual findings depend on the dataset used.)

Age distribution is concentrated between 20–40 years

Gender distribution shows imbalance

Survival rate is higher among females (for the Titanic dataset)

Fare tends to increase with passenger class

Strong correlation observed between Pclass and Fare
